# Welcome to HBNB - Airbnb Clone Project! 🏠🚀

## Hello there, welcome to my repo! 🐍✨

### Background Context
The AirBnB project is the  gateway to mastering Python programming! As I embark on this journey, I'll be delving into various essential Python concepts:

- Importing modules like a pro 📦
- Handling exceptions gracefully 🛠️
- Working with classes and objects 🎨
- Managing private attributes for data security 🔒
- Implementing getter/setter methods for data control 🎛️
- Leveraging class methods and static methods for functionality 🚀
- Understanding inheritance to build upon existing code 🏗️
- Writing robust unit tests for code validation ✅
- Read/write operations on files for data manipulation 📄

### What I'll Have Learned 🎓
By the end of this project, I'll have a solid grasp of these Python concepts, setting me up for success in my programming journey. I'll be able to confidently navigate through complex codebases, troubleshoot issues, and build robust applications with ease. 

### Here are the Requirements 📝
**Python Scripts**
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Ensure my code follows the style guidelines with pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- Don't forget to include a README.md file at the project root 📇
- All files should be executable 💥

**Python Unit Tests**
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Keep my tests organized within a folder named 'tests'
- Utilize the unittest module for comprehensive testing
- Organize my test files to mirror the project structure
- Run all tests using `python3 -m unittest discover tests`

## Let's Dive In and Level Up My Python Skills! 🚀✨
